  2. It your python version is 2.X, run the following on a terminal to start the server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  3. If your python version is 3.X, run the folliwng on a terminal to start the server `python3 -m http.server 8000`
  4. Visit [Python's Website](https://www.python.org/) to download python if you don't have it installed
  5. Lunch the application from `localhost:8000`
